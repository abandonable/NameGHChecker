<h1>Github Name Checker</h1>
</p>

## Information about the Project.
> This was just kinda a on the fly project to get a sick name on my new Github Account <br>I used a English Dictionary Wordlist Provided by [dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) and his cool EN Dictionary Lists

## How to use my GH Name Checker?

```
git clone https://github.com/abandonable/NameGHChecker
cd ./NameGHChecker

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/refs/heads/master/words_alpha.txt -o ./words.txt 
# If you like to get the list i used ^^^^^^^

git run . 
# Or "go build ." if you want a Static binary directly
```

If you want to use a Custom list save it in the project root ( aka in . of the folder) as words.txt <br> A config System is probably in sight when i find Time and Motivation.
